# IMPORTANT

* Though Clover is still being developed, I have made the choice to switch to OpenCore as my preferred bootloader. 

* Uploaded here is my last Clover configurations before switching.

* I will no longer support any issues you may have with Clover. 

* Moving forward, I will only make changes and improvements to my EFI-OpenCore folder. Therefore, I will be more than happy to discuss any OpenCore issues and/or improvements you bring.

* So my recommendation is, when you have the time, refer to my EFI-OpenCore folder as a reference and move to OpenCore as your bootloader.

Best,
