### Experimental branch - no docs, no guarantees. Untested - full of bugs - but maybe with new features? :)

Here be dragons! Docs are missing or incorrect at this point. May not boot at all.
I am not responsible for any damages you may cause.

> ## Warning & Notice

### This is an experimental branch for the Thinkpad X1 Carbon Generation 6-Repo by @tylernguyen.

Expects patched bios, patched TB-firmware and latest versions of everything. Big Sur only atm.
